# Algorithms in C

## About

This repository has simple programs in C for sorting and searching data. These programs help you understand how to organize and find data easily.

## Sorting Programs

1. **Selection Sort**: This program finds the smallest number in a list and moves it to the front. It repeats this until the list is sorted.

2. **Bubble Sort**: This program compares each pair of numbers in the list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It repeats this until the list is sorted.

3. **Merge Sort**: This program splits the list into two halves, sorts each half, and then combines them back together.

## Searching Programs

1. **Linear Search**: This program checks each number in the list one by one until it finds the target number or reaches the end.

2. **Binary Search**: This program only works on sorted lists. It divides the list into two parts and checks the middle number, then repeats this process until it finds the target number.
